## or
## How I doubled my salary while moving from academia to industry.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->



![alt text](assets/challengesdemotivator.jpeg "Challenges")



## About me five years ago:
* worked in neurosicence as a sysadmin/developer
* loved my job, working in science, loved coding
* boss was a Howard Hughes Investigator (decent pay, great benefits)
* job was pretty stable for staff in academia

Note:
My name is Maria Mckinley, and I am calling my talk Changing Direction, because I think the lessons I learned will be helpful to anyone moving into a career in software development.



## Boss decided to move across the country
## Suddenly unemployed<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
## But, I had over 10 years experience as a sysadmin/developer<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Sounds good, right?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->



## Issues
* Recession<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Sysadmin, most marketable skill, also my least favorite<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Languages coded in were mostly irrelevant to industry<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* self-taught, worked in a vacuum<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* Only knew two other developers in Seattle<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->



### Only knew two other developers in Seattle



# Lessons
* Never Assume
* Having a career is different from finding a job

Note: 
peppering the internet with resumes



# Spent a good year flailing

## Lessons
* Choose a short term goal and a long view direction
    * Can be simple, just something to focus on
    * for me: job where best pracices and developer growth are important
* Concentrate on what brings the most bang for your buck<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    for me:<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    * interviewing over whiteboarding
    * talks, teaching, coding events over small talk
* find support, may be a long haul<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Note: 
I found throwing resumes willy nilly to see if they stick to not be productive.
Story about whiteboard coding, practice helped for a while



## Desperation is not a good job mode
* create or join an informal group or meetup group of people looking for work<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    * acquaintances/friends/pyladies
    * exchange resumes, cover letters, practice interviews
* More general or professional help:<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    * WA State Career Centers
    * Matt Youngquist and Career Horizons



# Serendipity

Note:
When to take a job: does it closer to where you want to be?
this shows again the importance of knowing people
In job I love, but has some critical flaws



## Soul Searching
* Committed to coding, not sysadmin
* Introvert, but clearly needed to figure out this networking thing



## My goals:
* code, code, code: fill in knowledge gap<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* code with other developers<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* learn nuts and bolts of job hunting in 21st century<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* support<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:
there can be significant overlap



# A word about networking:
Your most important connections will be the ones who have worked with you, coded with you 
or see you as an expert on some level. How do you get this network?

Note:
do survey



## coding meetups, coding dojos, hackathons, programming nights
* learn craftsmanship/best practices as well as coding
* find your people
* pay attention to goals and technologies for right fit
* find your voice

Note:
If you have a tight resume/linkedin, you can get some headway with company recruiters,
but inside help will help get you past your deficiencies
Peter
getting your resume in the right hand useful, having a personal note on that resume, even better
giving talks, teaching - becoming an expert, better way to network,
When I started as a TA, I barely knew more than the students

## Create the support you need

Led me to TA position for python certificate program at uw.



## Online Presence
* LinkedIn
* Github
* Blog



## Seek out people in jobs you want and take them to coffee
* use your connections on linked in<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* ask them what skills they use in their job<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* how they got where they are/advice to follow similar path<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* what do they like/dislike about their present position<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



# Preparing for interviews:
* People love good stories<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* What are you missing because you are switching careers/paths/industries?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* What have you learned/done in your present, recent job/project that speaks to that?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* What can you do right now to help to close that gap?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* be persistant<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

# Yes, the game is rigged against you.

## Implicit Bias
* Implicit bias is a bias that you are unaware of<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* We are all affected by the culture we grow up in<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> 
* Explicit beliefs and implicit bias can, and often do, conflict<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

[Take a test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:
people will go to great lengths to justify implicit bias.
implicit bias affects minorities and women as well.
If you feel like you nailed an interview, but didn't hear back, think about what you may have missed, but don't dwell. It could just be implicit bias, so just consider that corporation as one we need to lure from the dark side, and move on.
for people hiring: check your assumptions, are you rejecting someone for reasons that you would overlook if they were white male? Look at pictures of famous women/minorities before interviewing/looking at resumes.

# You may also be working against yourself



## StereoType Threat



# How to overcome:
* support - pyladies, seek out role models who 'look like you'<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* think about what makes you, you. All of your unique qualities and accomplishments<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* read articles/books about women/minorities who code<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* understand that intelligence is not fixed, and you are definitely capable of becoming an expert coder: effort and motivation are what is important<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* body language, check out [Amy Cuddy's Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=175&v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->


## Imposter Syndrome



# How to overcome:
* knowledge is power<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* highly prevalent, can affects anyone, not just women/minorities<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* talk about it, chances are you have friends you have dealt with this<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* make a list of accomplishments, positive feedback and success stories<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->




## If you remember Nothing else from this talk:
* Find your voice, become known<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* practice your art (coding)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* do both simultaneously!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Note:
As with the literal act of gardening, pursuing any practice seriously is a generative, hardy way to live in the world. You are in charge (as much as we can ever pretend to be â€” sometimes like a sea captain hugging the rail in a hurricane); you plan; you design; you labor; you struggle. And your reward is that in some seasons you create a gratifying bounty.  -Malamud Smith



And now, if you will excuse me, I have to update my linkedin account, fix my blog and write some code.
