## About me four years ago:
## 10 years in academia as a sysadmin/developer
Sounds good, right?



## Issues
* Recession<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Sysadmin, most marketable skill, also my least favorite.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Languages used mostly irrelevant to industry.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* self-taught, worked in a vacuum.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* Only knew two other developers in Seattle.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->



### Only knew two other developers in Seattle



# Spent a good year flailing

## Soul Searching
* Wanted to code, not sysadmin
* Introvert, but clearly needed to figure out this networking thing



## My approach:
* code, code, code
* get to know other developers
* learn nuts and bolts of job hunting in 21st century
* find support, may be a long haul



Create these by placing 3 line-breaks in the markdown source.

_From here, you can move `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `DOWN`._ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

_Try `DOWN`._ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


## This is a vertical-slide
You make these by placing 2 line-breaks within the source.

Vertical-slides are good for drilling in to topics. Think of it as a _details_ slide. If you're short on time, you can skip past these slides by moving `RIGHT`.



## You can put images in a slide

<!-- .slide: data-background="MintCream" -->
## Style

You can style each slide individually.

_Cool background, right?_<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Hey, it even supports code!

```
var marker = L.marker([49, 5.49]).addTo(map);
var polygon = L.polygon([
  [51.509, -0.08],
  [51.503, -0.06],
  [51.51, -0.047]
]).addTo(map);
marker.bindPopup("<b>Hello world!</b><br>I am a popup.").openPopup();
polygon.bindPopup("I am a polygon.");
```



## Want to see something _really_ crazy?

Press `S` to check out the 'Presentation Mode'.

Note:
The idea is that you put the other window on a shared screen, like a projector, and view this screen on your laptop. Btw, this note is only visible to the presenter.



## That's about it
